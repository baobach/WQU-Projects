## Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City

In this project, I will demonstate how I build a machine learning model to predict the price of the apartment in Mexico city.
I will use jupyter notebook to wrangle the datasets contains data of housing price in Mexico city, build a data pipeline to fit the model, train the model and deploy the model.
All the original data can be find in "/data" folder.

1. The model only predict the price of the `apartment`. This can't be used to predict other type of real estate
2. I only train the model with value less than $100k to avoid outliers
3. After explore the data, there are some apartments have very large area so I will remove those as well to keep the data clean.

## 2015 Nepal Earthquake ML project help predict house condition after earthquake

In this project, I will use data from [2015 NEPAL Earthquake Data](https://eq2015.npc.gov.np/) to build a ML model using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree to predict the condition of buildings after the earthquake.
To use this notebook, please install catergory_encoders and scikit_learn libraries.

1. All the data is dowloaded from [2015 NEPAL Earthquake Data](https://eq2015.npc.gov.np/) and can be find in /csv_files folder.
2. Using both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree model to determine the best model to predict with highest accuracy.
